        <p>The console can be reached by right-clicking, selecting inspect and then going to the console option. You can use 
            different functions. You can do things such as: add, subtract, divide, multiply, squareroot and power. You can also 
            join different variavles by using the concat command. To create a variable, you have to write var and then the variable 
            name. Since it's JS, you have to write it in the cript tag in html.
